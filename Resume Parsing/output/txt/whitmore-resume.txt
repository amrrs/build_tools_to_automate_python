2014-
Present

2014 Insight Fellow, Insight Data Science, Palo Alto, CA, USA.

(cid:123) Created a Data Science project to predict the auction sale price of Abstract Expressionist art.

2011–2014 Postdoctoral Research Associate, Swinburne University, Melbourne, AUS.

(cid:123) Cleaned noisy and inhomogeneous astronomical data taken over four years by diﬀerent observing groups.
(cid:123) Curated central data repository of ﬁnal products; developed an automated process to update data

repository; created web interface for collaborator access to the repository.

(cid:123) Utilized numerous statistical techniques, including sensitivity analysis on non-linear propagation of
errors, Markov-Chain Monte Carlo for model building, and hypothesis testing via information criterion.
(cid:123) Simulated spectroscopic data to expose systematic errors that challenge long-standing results on whether

the fundamental physical constants of the universe are constant.

2005–2011 Graduate Student Researcher, UCSD, San Diego, CA, USA.

(cid:123) Developed a novel technique to extract information from high resolution spectroscopic data that led to

uncovering unknown short-range systematic errors.
